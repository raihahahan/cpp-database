# Introduction

This project aims to build a relational database from scratch, starting with an initial log-structured merge trees (LSM-trees) implementation, followed by B-trees.

# Pre-requisites

- CMake â€“ for configuring the build system
- Make
- C++20-compatible compiler
  - macOS: Apple Clang
  - Linux: GCC or Clang

# Setup

## 1. Install Catch2 for testing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
$ cd Catch2
$ cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
$ sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
```

If you do not have superuser rights, you will also need to specify [CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html) when configuring the build, and then modify your calls to [find_package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) accordingly.

More instructions here: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/cmake-integration.md#cmake-targets. Make sure to be at `devel` branch.

## 2. Makefiles

```
make           # Build (creates build/ and runs CMake+Make)
make run       # Build and run db_main
make clean     # Delete build/
make build     # Builds without tests
make test      # Builds and tests immediately
make rebuild   # Full clean + rebuild

```

## 3. Test CLI
```
cd build
./db_cli
```

# Project overview

This project is divided into four phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Key-Value Store with LSM-Tree Storage (current)
2. **Phase 2:** Key-Value Store with B-Tree Storage
3. **Phase 3:** Adding a relational layer
4. **Phase 4:** SQL and Query Execution

# Phase 1: Key-Value Store with LSM-Tree Storage

The first step is to build a basic key-value store using an LSM-tree storage engine, similar to LevelDB.

## Components

- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** Appends every write to disk for durability
- **Memtable:** An in-memory balanced tree (e.g. std::map) holding recent writes
- **SSTables:** Immutable, sorted files flushed from the memtable
- **Compactor:** Merges SSTables and drops overwritten/deleted keys

The get path checks the memtable, then recent SSTables, and so on. Each SSTable has a sparse in-memory index to reduce scan overhead. This gives me a fast, durable, and append-only key-value store.

# Phase 2 Key-Value Store with B-Tree Storage

Once the LSM version is working, I plan to add a second storage engine based on B-trees. This engine will share the same StorageEngine interface as the LSM version.

## Why B-Trees?

- Better read performance for point and range queries
- More suitable for in-place updates
- Serves as a foundation for future ACID semantics (via pages and MVCC)

## Components

The B-tree structure enables efficient lookups and range scans, with nodes aligned to page boundaries for cache and I/O efficiency.

- **BTree Nodes:** Each node stores sorted keys and child pointers
- **Pager:** Manages reading/writing pages to disk
- **Buffer Manager**: Caches pages in memory and handles eviction

# Phase 3: Adding a Relational Layer

At this point, I will build a logical layer on top of the key-value storage engine to support relational features like:

- Tables and schemas
- Row/column storage layout
- Transactions and isolation
- SQL-like APIs

This turns the storage engine into an actual database, with support for structured data and multiple tables.

## Components

This phase introduces more complex internals such as concurrency control and crash recovery at the logical level.

- **Table Abstraction:** Maps table names to key ranges or root pages
- **Catalog:** Stores schema metadata
- **Tuple Encoder:** Packs and unpacks rows into storage blocks
- **Transaction Manager:** Assigns transaction IDs and handles commits/rollbacks
- **MVCC Layer:** Supports concurrent readers and writers
- **Lock Manager or Optimistic Concurrency Control**

# Phase 4: SQL and Query Execution

Eventually, I'll add a SQL parser and basic query planner/executor. This would allow users to interact with the database using SQL.
